cost-of-small-modules
=========

A benchmark demonstrating the performance hit of different module bundlers, given different numbers of modules.

**ðŸ”’ Update:** This benchmark is locked because I believe it has served its purpose in my 2016 blog post. I don't intend to maintain it or update it any further.
